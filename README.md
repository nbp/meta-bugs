# Meta Bugs

When visiting bugzilla, a bug has a list of dependencies and a list of blocked
bug. This addons add a new read-only section which displays the transitive list
of blocked bug.

The addon is used as a discovery mechanism for finding siblings of existing
bugs, or to know what part of the project the current bug is contributing to.
